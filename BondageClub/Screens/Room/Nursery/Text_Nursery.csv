ChildGate,The nursery exit is barred with a tall child gate.  It has a tamper proof double locking catch keeping it shut.
EasyEscape,The lock is easy enough to open with you hands free.  Click on Escape to leave.
NoEasyEscape,"The tamper proof catch will be a challenge with your hands restrained.  Good babies are supposed to stay in the nursery.  Take too long or make too much noise and a nurse might notice you.  Click on Escape to try opening it.  A high evasion skill and less restrictive bondage will make it easier, but you might just be lucky."
EscapeSuccess,"Despite your predicament, you skillfully manage to open the gate.  Click on Escape again to leave."
EscapeFail0,"You try to open the lock, but your bondage makes it difficult and the mechanism slips shut again.   Click on Escape if you want to try again."
EscapeFail1,"You try to open the lock, it seems to be working until your vibrator distracts you and the mechanism slips shut again.   Click on Escape if you want to try again."
EscapeFail2,"You try to open the lock, but your bondage makes it difficult. You slip and the gate loudly clangs shut again.   Click on Escape if you want to try again."
EscapeFail3,"You try to open the lock, struggling in your bondage. The vibrator distracts you, making you moan loudly and let the mechanism slip shut again.   Click on Escape if you want to try again."
